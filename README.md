# Work-Day-Scheduler
a 9am - 5pm calendar app for scheduling you work day

Challenge:
  I was asked to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical work day (9am - 5pm). This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


Process:
  I added the current day that is displayed at the top of the calendar by utilizing the Day.js toolkit.
  I inputted the timeblocks between the hours of 9am to 5pm to reflect the typical hours of a work day.
  I added JS to the html to color-code the timeblock to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
  Whenever you click on the timeblock and enter in an event, you can click save and the text for that event is then saved into a local storage -- even when you refresh your page, your event is still present.
